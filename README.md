# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This is one of the projects for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).
Using provided art assets and the game engine, I built my version of a classic Frogger arcade game where a player needs to navigate a character to the top of the screen while avoiding a collision with an enemy.

#### Playing the game
The goal is simple, get a hero character to move across the gray bricks towards the water without getting hit by the swiftly moving enemy bugs. Each time a character reaches the water, the score increases by ten points and the character is reset back to the starting position. A player wins and the game is ended after 100 points are accumulated.
A player is given 3 spare lives that are displayed in the upper left corner as red hearts. A heart is removed when a hero character collides with an enemy bug. Player loses and the game gets reset when no hearts are left.

#### Movement and Controls
Navigate a hero character by using the main up/right/left/down arrow keys on the keyboard.
